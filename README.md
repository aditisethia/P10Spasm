# Spasm
The pdf file Spasm(P10) contains the graphs(except trees) that are homomorphic images of P10 and their respective matched tree decompositions. Every bag in the tree decomposition if of size at most 4, therefore, the matched tree width of any graph in Spasm(P10) is 3.

The files C10matchedEliminationTrees and C11matchedEliminationTrees contain the graphs in the spasm of C10 and C11 respectively and their corresponding matched elimination trees of depth at most 6.

The files "graph{x}e.g6" are graph6 encodings of all connected graphs on x edges, generated by the "geng" program, as follows:
- Install "geng" program.
- Run "geng -c n mmin:mmax <filename>" to generate all connected graphs on n vertices where the number of edges is in the range [mmin, mmax].

The file "allmtd6.pdf" contains matched elimination trees of depth at most 6 for all connected graphs on 6 to 11 edges. The program "mtd6.sage" takes the graph6 encodings and produces the above matched elimination trees. The algorithm is as follows:
- Use the heuristic where an arbitrary max-degree vertex is picked at each step to generate the elimination tree.
- If the heuristic fails to show mtd â‰¤ 6, then compute the mtd by brute-force.
